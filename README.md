# Sit on Chair - JavaScript
My second web project "Sit on Chair - JavaScript" was created during Coders Lab course. I used HTML, CSS3 and JavaScript. This is second step in my portfolio.
I started learning HTML, CSS and JavaScript a few months ago and now I can make website as you can see.
I had only screenshot of website and descripion how it should be working. Based on my knowledge I had to make this website.
The big challenge for me was to make dropdown menu and busket in JS but eventually I was successful.

## Used technologies
In my project I made use of, among other things:

HTML:
+ tags: header, section, footer, form, nav, button
+ attributes: id, class, href, alt

CSS:
+ z-index
+ display: flex
+ position: absolute, relative, fixed
+ pseudoclasses: :hover, :checked
+ pseudoelements ::before, ::after

JavaScript:
+ searching DOM Elements by querySelector/All
+ addEventListener: "click"
+ loops
+ adding classes, innerTexts, styles, 
+ photo slider
+ add shopping to the basket
+ automatic sum counting

and many more.
